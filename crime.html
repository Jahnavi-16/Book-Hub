  How is this list generated?
  <hr>
</p>

<p>This list is generated from 130 "best of" book lists from a variety of great sources. An algorithm is used to create a master list based on how many lists a particular book appears on. Some lists count more than others. I generally trust "best of all time" lists voted by authors and experts over user-generated lists. On the lists that are actually ranked, the book that is 1st counts a lot more than the book that's 100th. If you're interested in the details about how the rankings are generated and which lists are the most important please check out the list details page.</p>

If you have any comments, suggestions, or corrections please feel free to e-mail.
Given below are the top 10 to read books.
